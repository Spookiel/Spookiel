### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am BEng Computing (2025) student at Imperial College London. I have mainly focussed on Algorithms and Data Structures as I come from a competitive programming background, however I am also branching out into fullstack development and am interested in using the LLVM to implement my own programming language.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently preparing for ICPC qualifying rounds NWERC and UKIEPC 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Full-Stack Development with Django and PostgreSQL!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about British Informatics Olympiad solutions and competitive programming
